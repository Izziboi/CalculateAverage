# CalculateAverage
This C++ code calculates the average of numbers continuously as the user inputs them. It does not use the last total to calculate the next average, rather it uses the last average, the new number, and the number of numbers so far input. Also, it does not store the input numbers in an array or memory. This is to conserve memory.
